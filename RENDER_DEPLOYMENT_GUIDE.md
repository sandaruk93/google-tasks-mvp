# 🚀 Render Deployment Guide

## 📊 **Current Status**

**Local Development**: ✅ Running on `http://localhost:3000`
**Render Production**: ⏳ Old version still deployed (needs update)

## 🔧 **Manual Deployment Steps**

### **Step 1: Check Render Dashboard**
1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Find your `google-tasks-mvp` service
3. Check the deployment status and logs

### **Step 2: Trigger Manual Deployment**
If automatic deployment isn't working:

1. **In Render Dashboard**:
   - Click on your service
   - Go to "Manual Deploy" section
   - Select `gemini-integration` branch
   - Click "Deploy latest commit"

2. **Or via Render CLI** (if you have it installed):
   ```bash
   render deploy google-tasks-mvp
   ```

### **Step 3: Verify Deployment**
After deployment completes, check:

```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl https://google-tasks-mvp.onrender.com/health

# Check main page for new features
curl https://google-tasks-mvp.onrender.com/ | grep -i "omnia"
```

## 🎯 **What Should Be Deployed**

### **New Features**
- ✅ **Modern Navigation Bar** with glassmorphism effect
- ✅ **Beautiful Landing Page** with hero section
- ✅ **File Upload Interface** with drag-and-drop
- ✅ **Enhanced Security** with all security headers
- ✅ **Responsive Design** for all devices

### **Technical Improvements**
- ✅ **Static File Serving** for CSS/JS assets
- ✅ **Health Check Endpoint** for Render monitoring
- ✅ **Security Middleware** stack
- ✅ **Error Handling** and logging
- ✅ **Performance Optimization** with compression

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Deployment Fails**

1. **Check Build Logs**:
   - Go to Render Dashboard
   - Click on your service
   - Check "Build Logs" for errors

2. **Common Issues**:
   - **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure all packages are in `package.json`
   - **Port Issues**: Verify `PORT` environment variable
   - **Start Command**: Check `npm start` works locally

3. **Environment Variables**:
   Make sure these are set in Render:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=10000
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
   SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
   ```

### **If Old Version Still Shows**

1. **Clear Cache**:
   - Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
   - Clear browser cache
   - Try incognito mode

2. **Check DNS**:
   - DNS might take time to propagate
   - Wait 5-10 minutes after deployment

3. **Verify Branch**:
   - Ensure Render is deploying from `gemini-integration` branch
   - Check if branch is up to date
